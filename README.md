# Task1 - PCA and Clustering [50 marks]
</br>1.1: Displays the images of the first 10 samples of each class, so each figure shows the 10 samples for class Ck.
</br>1.2: Calculates a mean vector of data for each class, and displays the images of K+1 mean vectors.
</br>1.3: a. Compute the Principal Components of a data set. b. Carry out PCA, compute Cumulative Variances, find Minimum number of PCA dimensions to cover 70%, 80%, 90% of total variance. 
</br>1.4: Displays the images of the first 10 principal axes of PCA.
</br>1.5: a. Carry out k-means clustering. b. Calls the k-mean clustering function for each k in a vector Ks, using the Ô¨Årst k samples in the data set X as the initial cluster centres.
</br>1.6: Displays image of each cluster centre.
</br>1.7: Visualises cluster regions on the 2D-PCA plane, where the position of the plane is specified by a point vector.
</br>1.8: Investigate the k-means clustering in terms of initial cluster centres.

# Task 2 - Classification [50 marks]
</br>2.1: a. Compute classification with k-NN. b. Create confusion matrix. c. Run classification, measure user time, save matrix for each k, display information.
</br>2.2: Visualises deicision regions of k-NN on a 2D PCA plane.
</br>2.3: Transforms data to the ones in 2D PCA space and plots contour of Gaussian distribution for each class.
</br>2.4: Calculates correlation on 2D-PCA for each class and for all the classes
</br>2.5: a. Classification with a single Gaussian distribution per class. b. Classification experiment.
</br>2.6: Visualises decision regions of the Gaussian classifiers on a 2D-PCA plane.
</br>2.7: Run experiment using a subset of training data.
</br>2.8: Function that applies k-means clustering to each class to obtain multiple Gaussian classifier per class, and carries out classification.
